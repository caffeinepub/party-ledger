# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display all unique party names in the system and resolve duplicate party records.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a comprehensive list view showing all party names in the system
- Investigate and resolve duplicate party records (e.g., "ABC AUTO PARTS Bangesimal" appearing three times with identical details)
- Ensure each party appears exactly once while preserving payment history and visit records

**User-visible outcome:** Users can view a complete, deduplicated list of all parties with each party appearing only once, accessible from the main navigation.
