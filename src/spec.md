# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove duplicate party name displays in the user interface.

**Planned changes:**
- Eliminate duplicate party name displays where the same party name appears multiple times in a single view or component
- Ensure party names are displayed only once per logical grouping across all UI components

**User-visible outcome:** Party names will appear only once in each view, providing a cleaner and less redundant interface while maintaining all necessary information.
