# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add dashboard notifications for parties with visits due today and enable party search in reports.

**Planned changes:**
- Display notifications on the dashboard for parties whose next visit day is today with party name and clickable call button
- Add a search box to the Reports page that filters the party dropdown by name, phone number, or PAN
- Implement backend query to fetch parties with next payment date matching today's date

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see which parties are due for visits today on the dashboard and quickly call them. In the Reports page, users can search and filter parties by name, phone, or PAN to find records faster.
