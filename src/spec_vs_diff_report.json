  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to 6 frontend files focused on removing duplicate party name displays. The changes align well with REQ-1, particularly in dashboard components where party names were displayed redundantly. The modifications maintain functionality while improving UI clarity by showing party names once per logical grouping.",

    {
      "description": "Modifications to PaymentHistory component that appear to remove payment details (amount, date, location visualization)",
      "reason": "The diff shows PaymentHistory.tsx was modified but the changes appear to remove payment detail display elements that were not requested for removal. The BuildRequest only asked to remove duplicate party names, not payment information display.",
