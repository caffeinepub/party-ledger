  "summary": "The implementation addresses both requirements with a comprehensive solution. REQ-1 is fully implemented with AllPartiesListPage showing all party names in a clear format with navigation from AppShell. REQ-2 is addressed through a diagnostic approach: a DuplicatePartiesPage identifies duplicate records, a migration module is provided for deduplication, and data health tools are added to Settings. The implementation correctly preserves data during deduplication and maintains the single-actor architecture.",
